\subsection{Notations}

We use $x \sample X$ to denote the uniformly random sampling from a set $X$. In description of $\Party_i$, we use $\pcsend x \pcto \Party_j$ to denote the action of sending the message $x$ to $\Party_j$ via a secret messaging channel.

Let $\Field$ be a finite field, all variables of polynomials are taken in $\Field$. We denote by $\BiSet{s,\NumCor}$ the set of all bivariate polynomials $S(x,y)$ with degree $\NumCor$ for both variables $x,y$ and $S(0,0) = s$.
