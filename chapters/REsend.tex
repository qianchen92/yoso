\section{More Efficient Randomness Generation in the Sending-Leaks Model}

We first give a new randomness generation protocol in the sending-leaks model with $\NumP  = 6 \NumCor+2$, then we improve the protocol into $\NumP = 5 \NumCor+2$.

We first divide $6\NumCor+2$ parties into $2$ sets: $3 \NumCor+1$ verifiers $\Verifier_1, \ldots, \Verifier_{3\NumCor+1}$ and $3 \NumCor+1$ publishers $\Publisher_1, \ldots, \Publisher_{3\NumCor+1}$. We denote the set of all subsets $\Sets = \left\{ S \in [3\NumCor+1]\mid |S| = 2\NumCor+1 \right\}$. 

Our first protocol $\RGSa$ proceeds as follows
